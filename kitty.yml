# A list of languages that kitty can use.
languages:
  # Languages must contain a display name that matches Kattis' name for the
  # language exactly - i.e. the precise text in the language dropdown menu at
  # https://open.kattis.com/submit. If you get an error saying "something went
  # wrong during submission", this may be a likely reason!

  # They must also be connected to a file extension such that kitty knows which
  # language a file is written in.
  file_extension: rs
  # An optional shell command to compile the program. If the language does not
  # require a separate compilation step before running the code, omit this.
  compile_command: rustc --out-dir $DIR_PATH $SRC_PATH
  # A shell command to run the program. For most compiled languages, a path to
  # the compiled executable suffices.
  run_command: $EXE_PATH
  # Compilation and run commands can make use of variables as illustrated by the
  # examples. The variables, $<name>, will be replaced with their value for the
  # given solution folder. Available variables are:
  #   - $SRC_PATH: The path to the program's source code file
  #   - $SRC_FILE_NAME_NO_EXT: The name of the source code file, stripped of its
  #         file extension (for example: Program.java -> Program)
  #   - $DIR_PATH: The path to the solution folder containing the program source
  #   - $EXE_PATH: The path to the compiled executable

  run_command: $EXE_PATH
  # Some languages require different tools across platforms. Kitty's solution to
  # this is to use windows/unix settings. Any setting you write under windows or
  # unix will overwrite the one in the base level.
  windows:

  unix:
    compile_command: mcs -out:$EXE_PATH $SRC_PATH
